- Tweak: Various style improvements to admin pages for consistency.

= v2.0.10 - 10/01/2023 =

- Improvement: If no v1 global restrictions existed, skip the migration step entirely.

- Fix: Backward compatibility issue with WP versions <6.2 that made settings page not render.
- Fix: Bug where Block Controls didn't work on WooCommerce pages. This was filtering `pre_render_block` but not returning a value. Now we run our check after theirs to ensure that bug has no effect on our plugin. [Report](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/issues/11077)
